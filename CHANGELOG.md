# v0.7.0

This change introduced a series of changes to support a new "dynamic quota" ticket
allocation strategy. This code primarily affects bulkheads (protected resources).

Rather than statically setting a ticket count, workers (in their own process) now register
themselves. By specifying 'quota' instead of 'tickets', the bulkhead threshold will now be
computed dynamically as a ratio of the number of registered workers, eliminating the need to
continuously readjust ticket counts, and supporting environments with non-uniform worker
distribution between machines.

* Feature: Support quota based allocation strategy (#120)
