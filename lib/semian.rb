#
# === Overview
#
# Semian is a library that can be used to control access to external services.
#
# It's desirable to control access to external services so that in the case that one
# is slow or not responding, the performance of an entire system is not compromised.
#
# Semian uses the concept of a "resource" as an identifier that controls access
# to some external service. So for example, "mysql" or "redis" would be considered
# resources. If a system is sharded, like a database, you would typically create
# a resource for every shard.
#
# Resources are visible across an IPC namespace. This means that you can register a
# resource in one process and access it from another. This is useful in application
# servers like Unicorn that are multi-process. A resource is persistent. It will
# continue to exist even after the application exits, and will only be destroyed by
# manually removing it with the <code>ipcrm</code> command, calling Resource.destroy,
# or rebooting the machine.
#
# Each resource has a configurable number of tickets. Tickets are what controls
# access to the external service. If a client does not have a ticket, it cannot access
# a service. If there are no tickets available, the client will block for a configurable
# amount of time until a ticket is available. If there are no tickets available after
# the timeout period has elapsed, the client will be unable to access the service and
# an error will be raised.
#
# Resources also integrate a circuit breaker in order to fail faster and to let the
# resource the time to recover. If `error_threshold` errors happen in the span of `error_timeout`
# then the circuit will be opened and every attempt to acquire the resource will immediately fail.
#
# Once in open state, after `error_timeout` is elapsed, the ciruit will transition in the half-open state.
# In that state a single error will fully re-open the circuit, and the circuit will transition back to the closed
# state only after the resource is acquired `success_threshold` consecutive times.
#
# A resource is registered by using the Semian.register method.
#
# ==== Examples
#
# ===== Registering a resource
#
#    Semian.register(:mysql_shard0, tickets: 10, timeout: 0.5, error_threshold: 3, error_timeout: 10, success_threshold: 2)
#
# This registers a new resource called <code>:mysql_shard0</code> that has 10 tickets and a default timeout of 500 milliseconds.
#
# After 3 failures in the span of 10 seconds the circuit will be open.
# After an additional 10 seconds it will transition to half-open.
# And finally after 2 successulf acquisitions of the resource it will transition back to the closed state.
#
# ===== Using a resource
#
#    Semian[:mysql_shard0].acquire do
#      # Perform a MySQL query here
#    end
#
# This acquires a ticket for the <code>:mysql_shard0</code> resource. If we use the example above, the ticket count would
# be lowered to 9 when block is executed, then raised to 10 when the block completes.
#
# ===== Overriding the default timeout
#
#    Semian[:mysql_shard0].acquire(timeout: 1) do
#      # Perform a MySQL query here
#    end
#
# This is the same as the previous example, but overrides the timeout from the default value of 500 milliseconds to 1 second.
